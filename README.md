-Run the SensitiveWordsDB script on MSSQL to create your Database and table.
-Download and open the application on VisualStudio
-Change MYSQLINSTANCE on the appsettings of the API to your own instance.
-Build and run the application

*What would you do to enhance performance of your project?*
- Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the number of database queries and improve response times for frequently accessed data.
Use in-memory caching (e.g., Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory) for caching sensitive words or other small datasets that don't change frequently.
- Properly index the database tables, particularly for frequently accessed or joined tables, to optimize query performance.
Analyze the SQL queries generated by Entity Framework Core and create appropriate indexes based on the query patterns.

*What additional enhancements would add to the project to make it more complete?*
-Implement search functionality to better locate a sensitive word for modification.
-Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms in both the API and MVC projects.
-Implement exception handling and logging mechanisms in both projects.
-Implement caching mechanisms in the MVC project to improve performance when interacting with the API.
-Implement unit testing and integration testing for both projects.
-Implement deployment scripts or pipelines for easy deployment of the API and MVC projects.
-Use a client-side framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js for the frontend instead of the MVC project.

*A walkthrough of how i think the Sensitive Words application should be deployed in a production environment.*

-Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated build, testing, and deployment.
-Containerize the application components (web, API, database) using Docker.
-Use a private container registry to manage and version container images.
-Provision the necessary infrastructure resources (VMs, load balancers, databases) using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools.
-Deploy the containerized application using a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes, enabling rolling updates, scaling, and high availability.
-Implement monitoring, logging, and alerting solutions for observability and troubleshooting.
-Integrate the CI/CD pipeline with the container registry, IaC tools, and container orchestration for automated deployments.
-Enforce security best practices, including network security, encryption, and access controls.
-Provision a highly available and scalable database solution with backup, replication, and disaster recovery strategies.
-Conduct load testing and optimize the application's performance based on monitoring data.
-Document the deployment process, infrastructure configurations, and provide training for operations and support teams.
