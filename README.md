-Run the SensitiveWordsDB script on MSSQL to create your Database and table.
-Download and open the application on VisualStudio
-Change MYSQLINSTANCE on the appsettings of the API to your own instance.
-Build and run the application

*What would you do to enhance performance of your project?*
- Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the number of database queries and improve response times for frequently accessed data.
Use in-memory caching (e.g., Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory) for caching sensitive words or other small datasets that don't change frequently.
- Properly index the database tables, particularly for frequently accessed or joined tables, to optimize query performance.
Analyze the SQL queries generated by Entity Framework Core and create appropriate indexes based on the query patterns.

*What additional enhancements would add to the project to make it more complete?*
-Implement search functionality to better locate a sensitive word for modification.
-Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms in both the API and MVC projects.
-Implement exception handling and logging mechanisms in both projects.
-Implement caching mechanisms in the MVC project to improve performance when interacting with the API.
-Implement unit testing and integration testing for both projects.
-Implement deployment scripts or pipelines for easy deployment of the API and MVC projects.
-Use a client-side framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js for the frontend instead of the MVC project.

*A walkthrough of how i think the Sensitive Words application should be deployed in a production environment.*

Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated build, testing, and deployment of the SensitiveWords.Api and SensitiveWords.Web projects.
Containerize the SensitiveWords.Api and SensitiveWords.Web applications, along with their dependencies, using Docker.
Use a private container registry to manage and version the container images for SensitiveWords.Api and SensitiveWords.Web.
Provision the SQL Server as an infrastructure resource, using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools for hosting the SensitiveWords.Api and SensitiveWords.Web applications.
Deploy the containerized SensitiveWords.Api and SensitiveWords.Web applications using a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes, enabling rolling updates, scaling, and high availability.
Implement monitoring, logging, and alerting solutions to monitor the SensitiveWords.Api and SensitiveWords.Web applications, enabling observability and troubleshooting.
Integrate the CI/CD pipeline with the container registry, IaC tools, and container orchestration platform to automate the deployment of SensitiveWords.Api and SensitiveWords.Web.
Enforce security best practices, including network security, encryption, and access controls, for the SensitiveWords.Api and SensitiveWords.Web applications and their associated resources.
Document the deployment process, infrastructure configurations, and application components for the SensitiveWords.Api and SensitiveWords.Web applications, and provide training for operations and support teams.
